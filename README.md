## Introduction

This is a Rails application built using Rails 7, PostgreSQL (psql), and Devise for authentication. It provides a foundation for building web applications with user authentication and a database backend.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Change the application and database names:
   - Open the `config/application.rb` file.
   - Locate the line `module YourApplicationName` and change `YourApplicationName` to the desired name for your application.
   - Open the `config/database.yml` file.
   - Change the `database:` field under the desired environment (e.g., development, test, production) to the desired name for your database.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   bundle install
   ```
4. Set up the database:
   ```
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```
5. Create a `.env` file manually by following the provided `.env.sample` file. This file should contain any environment-specific configuration variables required by your application.

## Usage

To start the Rails server, run the following command:
```
rails server
```

Once the server is running, you can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

- Ruby (version X.X.X)
- Rails (version 7.X.X)

Ensure that you have these dependencies installed and configured correctly before running the application.
